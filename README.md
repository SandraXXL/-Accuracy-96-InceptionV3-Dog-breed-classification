Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This project is still in the works, so right now, you'll only find the model training part here. The plan is to eventually turn this into a full iOS app (most likely) or maybe a web platform.

Stay tunedâ€”things are still evolving!

## Test result:

I've tested on a random image of a cocker dog which I found on pinterest, the top 1 result is indeed cocker with 0.99 confidence score.
