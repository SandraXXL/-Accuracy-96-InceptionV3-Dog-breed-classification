Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This project is still in the works. Currently, you'll find only the model training and basic web pages for image uploading and result display; I am still looking for a way to host the web app (I tried PythonAnywhere, but it has compatibility issues with my model. I also tried Ngrok, which works, but the link is temporary).

Stay tunedâ€”things are still evolving!

## Test image:

I've tested on a random image of a cocker dog which I found on pinterest, the top 1 result is indeed cocker with 0.99 confidence score.

## Steps of running python web app (in local environment):

1. go to your terminal/cmd and locate in the directory that contains 'app3.py';

2. run command 'python app3.py' or 'python3 app3.py' to start the web app;

3. use the local URL to access the web pages
